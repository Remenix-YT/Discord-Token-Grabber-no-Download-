# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Version 1.2 is the only version with security updates  

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.1.x   | :x: |
| 1.2.x   | :white_check_mark:                |
| 1.3.x   | :x:                |
| < 1.4   | :x:                |

1.1 no longer recieves security updates and is still safe to use but it will for sure be patched and will probably get you insta banned if not patched beacause the anti ban in it is no longer be updated along side the security of it
